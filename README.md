## Data Cleaning and Preparation
#### The dataset contained a lot of missing values, and the dataset being a sales data means a carefully done data preprocessing.
#### I created a column first to calculate the total price for each record, then I dropped every record whose total price returned zero.
#### Then, I filtered and checked for other missing values and I replaced them with either zero or "null" for numbered fields and text fields respectively.
